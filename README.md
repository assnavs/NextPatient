# NextPatient — Smart Queue & Token Management for Healthcare

NextPatient is a lightweight, fast, and modern hospital OPD queue and token management system built using Flask (Python) as the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript as the frontend.
It streamlines patient flow, reduces overcrowding, and ensures a seamless experience across OPD, Lab, and Pharmacy departments.

The project enables patients to register, get tokens, track their queue status in real-time, and view estimated waiting times. Staff can manage queues efficiently, call next patients, mark visits as completed, and monitor activity logs.
